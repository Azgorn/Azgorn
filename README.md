# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello there! I'm Damyan, a passionate software developer with a strong focus on back-end development. I primarily work with three main programming languages: C#, Java, and Python.

## ðŸ’¼ Background

I love solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and ensuring the reliability and security of software applications. Here's a bit more about my experience with the three main languages I use:

- **C#:** I have extensive experience with C# and have worked on a variety of applications and services using the .NET framework. From ASP.NET for web development to Windows Forms for desktop applications, I enjoy the versatility and performance that C# provides.

- **Java:** I recently started learning and using Java as part of my programming course and I use it for all kinds of purposes.

- **Python:** Python is my go-to language for scripting. I picked up Manim and  I'm working on creating **animations for mathematics**.

## ðŸš€ Projects

I have worked on a variety of projects, and you can find some of them on my GitHub repositories. Here are a few highlights:

- **[Books.me](https://github.com/Books-me/Books.me):** A C# application for reading and organising books.

- **[Minesweeper](https://github.com/pbogre/minesweeper-CBL):** A Java-based implementation of classic minesweeper with advanced features.

- **[Manim](link-to-project-3):** A Python application using Manim for animation on mathematical objects.

These are just a few examples of my work, and I'm constantly exploring new projects and technologies.
